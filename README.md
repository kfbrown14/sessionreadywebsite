# Session Ready

Session Ready is a therapist training tool designed to help aspiring and practicing therapists hone their client interaction skills in a simulated environment. It presents a variety of AI-driven client personas, allowing trainees to practice their interventions by typing (and soon, speaking). The application, powered by Google Gemini, simulates client responses and provides real-time feedback on the student's technique.

In short, Session Ready coaches therapists on how to effectively communicate with diverse clients facing various conditions before they engage in real-world practice.

## Project Overview

This project is a [React](https://react.dev/) application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), utilizing [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. The backend is powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Landing Page**: A welcoming entry point with clear navigation to all sections of the application, including "Practice", "About", "Features", and "Community".
*   **AI-Driven Client Personas**: Select from a list of pre-defined client scenarios, each with a unique profile (e.g., teens with trauma, adults with anxiety).
*   **Realistic Role-Playing**: Engage in text-based (voice input planned for the future) conversations with AI clients.
    *   Type your therapeutic interventions in a chat interface.
    *   Receive dynamic responses from the AI client, powered by Google Gemini, simulating a real therapy session.
*   **Real-Time Feedback**: After ending a session, receive constructive feedback on your technique, conversational flow, and overall interaction, also generated by Google Gemini.
*   **Safe Learning Environment**: Practice and refine therapeutic communication skills without the pressure and risks of real-world client interactions.
*   **Responsive Design**: Access the platform on various devices thanks to a responsive user interface.
