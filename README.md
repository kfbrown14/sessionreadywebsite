# Session Ready

Session Ready is a therapist training tool designed to help aspiring and practicing therapists hone their client interaction skills in a simulated environment. It presents a variety of AI-driven client personas, allowing trainees to practice their interventions by typing (and soon, speaking). The application, powered by Google Gemini, simulates client responses and provides real-time feedback on the student's technique.

In short, Session Ready coaches therapists on how to effectively communicate with diverse clients facing various conditions before they engage in real-world practice.

## Project Overview

This project is a [React](https://react.dev/) application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), utilizing [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. The backend is powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## Key Features
